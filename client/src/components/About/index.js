            My name is Eric Yarbrough! I went to the University of Texas at Austin and graduated in May of 2020 with a B.A. in Anthropology. I know I know, a liberal arts major, but I’ve seen the light, and now I’m addicted to coding. Covid-19 has kept my face glued to the computer. I'm always working or keeping busy and definitely laughing.

          <p className="text-break m-3">
            When I'm not working I enjoy playing competitive F.P.S. games on my PC. I'm addicted to Valorant and main Cypher and Sova.

            I love reading fantasy or horror books. I'm trying to tackle George R.R. Martin's series "A Song of Ice and Fire". Star Wars: The Clone Wars is by far one of my favorite series, that along with Avatar: The Last Airbender. My favorite characters include Ashoka Tano, Uncle Iroh, and Azula.

            Family is monumental to me, I wouldn’t be where I am in life without the support of my loved ones.

            I lean towards the back-end of code and find comfort in manipulating data. I can work with both SQL and NoSQL databases and follow the M.V.C. paradigm to give my code structure.  However, I do love a good color palette and find myself mentally redesigning websites. My style is minimal with a touch of playfulness.
          </p>
          <p className="text-break m-3">
            I tend to work closely with people and will regularly touch base and relay ideas that might come-up. I thoroughly enjoy the brainstorming process and planning out code in my notebook (its full of rough sketches and terrible ideas).
